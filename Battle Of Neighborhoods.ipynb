    "Undoubtedly, Food Diversity is an important part of an ethnically diverse metropolis. The idea of this project is to categorically segment the neighborhoods of New York City into major clusters and examine their cuisines. A desirable intention is to examine the neighborhood cluster’s food habits and taste. Further examination might reveal if food has any relationship with the diversity of a neighborhood. This project will help to understand the diversity of a neighborhood by leveraging venue data from Foursquare’s ‘Places API’ and ‘k-means clustering’ unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will help to discover further about the culture and diversity of the neighborhood.This quantifiable analysis can be used to understand the distribution of different cultures and cuisines over ‘the most diverse city on the planet — New York City’. Also, it can be utilized by a new food vendor who is willing to open his or her restaurant. Or by a government authority to examine and study their city’s culture diversity better.</pre>"

    "Download and Explore New York City Dataset\n",
    "In order to segment the neighborhoods of New York City, a dataset is required that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods, that exist in each borough, with respective latitude and longitude coordinates. This dataset is downloaded using the mentioned URL.\n",
    "Once the .json file is downloaded, it is analyzed to understand the structure of the file. A python dictionary is returned by the URL and all the relevant data is found to be in the features key, which is basically a list of the neighborhoods. The dictionary is transformed, into a pandas dataframe, by looping through the data and filling the dataframe rows one at a time.\n",
    "As a result, a dataframe is created with Borough, Neighborhood, Latitude and Longitude details of the New York City’s neighborhood.\n",
    "Upon analysis, it is found that the dataframe consists of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods.\n",
    "Further, ‘geopy’ library is used to get the latitude and longitude values of New York City, which was returned to be Latitude: 40.71, Longitude: -74.01.\n",
    "The curated dataframe is then used to visualize by creating a map of New York City with neighborhoods superimposed on top. The following depiction is a map generated using python ‘folium’ library.\n",

    "1. ‘neighborhoods’ which contains the Borough, Neighborhood, Latitude and Longitude details of the New York City’s neighborhood, and\n",

    "One application of Clustering Algorithm, k-Means or others, to a multi-dimensional dataset, a very inquisitive result can be curated which helps to understand and visualize the data. The neighborhoods of New York City were very briefly segmented into eight clusters and upon analysis, it was possible to rename them basis upon the categories of venues in and around that neighborhood. Along with American cuisine, Italian and Chinese are very dominant in New York City and so is the diversity statistics.\n",
    "The results of this project can be improved and made more inquisitive by using a current New York City’s dataset along with API platforms which are more interested in Food Venues (like Yelp, etc.) The scope of this project can be expanded further to understand the dynamics of each neighborhood and suggest a new vendor a profitable location to open his or her food place. Also, a government authority can utilize it to examine and study their city’s culture diversity better.</pre>"
